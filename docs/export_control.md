## 1. Overview of Export Restrictions

The U.S. Government controls exports of sensitive equipment, software and technology as a means to promote U.S. national security interests and foreign policy objectives.

## 2. Application to Software

Software is regulated by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, under the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"). A software export under the EAR includes "any release of technology or software subject to the EAR in a foreign country," or any release of "source code subject to the EAR to a foreign national."
The term "release" is defined very broadly to include inspection by foreign nationals, exchanges of information, or the application of personal knowledge or technical experience acquired in the United States.

## 3. Exceptions

EAR excludes publicly-available software, except for some encryption technology. Other exceptions may be available for non-publicly licensed software. To determine if exceptions are available, faculty principal investigators should contact the UNM Main Campus Office of Export Control for guidance prior to requesting EAR-controlled software installations on CARC systems.  A written exception from UNM Export Control will be required.

## 4. Installation of Export Control Software

All requests for installation of export-controlled software on CARC systems will require prior written approval or a written exception from UNM Export Control.
